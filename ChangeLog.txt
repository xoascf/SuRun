Done, to be tested:
---------------------------

ToDo
---------------------
* Console SuRun support
* Create a "Default" SuRunner for users that are not in "SuRunners"

To be done in future:
---------------------
* Use Radio-Buttons for (normal/elevated) Auto-Magic
* Hide/Show all context menu entries consistently
* make all context menu entries dynamically with ShellExt 
  (E.g.: msi with popup-menu)
* use MD5-Hash for "Always Yes" programs

Deferred Whishlist:
---------------------
* Intercept "rundll32.exe newdev.dll,": 
    needs CredUI hack for XP/2k3; ok with 2k and Vista
    use "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File 
    Execution Options\Rundll32.exe",Debugger,C:\Windows\SuRun.exe /AUTORUN

SuRun Changes:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SuRun 1.2.0.6 beta 13 - 2009-01-22:
-----------------------------------
* new Application flag
* Changed program list flag descriptions for (hopefully) better understanding
* SuRuns inter process communication automatically times out after 15 seconds 
  if a client app opens the service pipe without sending data (DOS attack)
* FIX: If a program in the users automagic list was about to be started and 
  the password timed out, SuRun asked the wrong question.
* FIX: If ask for users password was enabled, SuRun Settings did not ask for 
  the password after the timeout.

SuRun 1.2.0.6 beta 12 - 2009-01-15:
-----------------------------------
* new Command line Option /WAIT. SuRun waits until the elevated process exits.
* new Command line Option /RETPID. SuRun returns the Process ID of the 
  elevated process.
* Tray symbol now reappears if Explorer is restarted
* If SuRun uses Vistas Split-Admin token, it is now protected against access 
  from the non-elevated user

SuRun 1.2.0.6 beta 11 - 2008-12-25:
-----------------------------------
* FIX: When importing users SuRun removed all imported users from the local 
    administrators group even when UAC is enabled. Now SuRun leaves UAC admins
    in the local administrators group.
* FIX: The SuRun function "HasRegistryKeyAccess" freed (LocalFree) a DACL 
    pointer that was not allocated. That caused "SuRun /SETUP" to creash in 
    Vista x64. SuRuns unhandled exception filter was not called by the System!

SuRun 1.2.0.6 beta 10 - 2008-12-17:
-----------------------------------
* SuRuns command line resolver did not handle control panel applets correctly
* SuRuns Beta has a new option "/CRASH" to test DrWtsn32

SuRun 1.2.0.6 beta 9 - 2008-12-16:
----------------------------------
* MyCPAU uses impersonation if CreateProvessasUser returns ERROR_DIRECTORY

SuRun 1.2.0.6 beta 8 - 2008-12-16:
----------------------------------
* WatchDog process terminates itself if SuRuns Desktop is no longer running
* Enhanced Debug-Out for "MyCPAU"

SuRun 1.2.0.6 beta 7 - 2008-12-11:
----------------------------------
* FIX: If a safe Windows Desktop is active ("Winlogon", "Disconnect", 
  "Screen-saver"), SuRun did automatically cancel all ShellExecute requests, 
  even those that where marked as "always run elevated" and "no ask".
  Now SuRun does correctly handle apps that are marked as "always run elevated"
  and "no ask" and auto-cancels all requests that require SuRuns safe desktop.
* NEW: Option to adjust, hide and disable the "Cancel" Timeout
* NEW: Service uses the the user's keyboard layout
* NEW: LogonUser uses impersonation
* CHG: RunAs-Logon-Dialog does not always check if Password is valid
* CHG: removed "SuRun /RunAs" support to start programs with elevated rights 
* CHG: removed support of SuRun Confirmation Dialog to switch to "RunAs"

SuRun 1.2.0.6 beta 6 - 2008-11-25:
----------------------------------
* SuRun Message Boxes are system modal
* SuRun does no Desktop fade in/out, when the user is in a Terminal session
* BlackList Match filter does Long/Short file name conversion
* Blacklist "Add" Button does not set quotes
* SuRun /RunAs supports starting programs with elevated rights. To use this
  the invoker of SuRun /RunAs must be Administrator or unrestricted SuRunner
* SuRun Confirmation Dialog supports switching to another User
* On Vista SuRun does to not detect installers per default
* FIX: SuRuns IATHook does not intercept calls to GetProcAddress() any more. 
  This caused Outlook 2007 with Exchange Server and Windows Destkop Search 
  to crash.

SuRun 1.2.0.6 beta 5 - 2008-11-13:
----------------------------------
* SuRuns IAT-Hook suspends all Threads in a process before modifying the IAT.
  Hopefully this finally solves the Outlook 2007 and Eclipse problems.
* SuRun sends Messages to Widows Debug output if something fails while trying 
  to start an elevated process. Hopefully this helps to fix the Problems with 
  SuRun in Domains.
* FIX: "SuRun /BACKUP" did not work at all!
* FIX: "SuRun /BACKUP" and "SuRun /RESTORE" did not support "quoted" file names
* "SuRun /RESTORE" now displays a "File not found" message

SuRun 1.2.0.6 beta 4 - 2008-11-12:
----------------------------------
* "'Administrators' instead of 'Object creator' as default owner for objects 
  created by administrators." policy is left as it is on SuRun Update
* new command line option "/BACKUP <file>"
* VISTA: SuRun works for UAC-Administrators. If a UAC-Administrator is in 
  SuRunners he/she can use SuRun as normal SuRunner.
* VISTA: When UAC is enabled and Admins are put into SuRunners, they are NOT 
    removed from "Administrators"
* VISTA: Split Admins get the elevated token

----------------------------------
* SuRun can be compiled using Visual C++ 8 (2005)
* SuRuns GUI Windows are moved to the primary Monitor
	
SuRun 1.2.0.6 beta 2 - 2008-10-23:
----------------------------------
* SuRuns GUI is closed when Winlogon shows up (e.G. if a user presses <WIN>+"L" 
  while the SuRun GUI is active).

SuRun 1.2.0.6 beta 1 - 2008-10-19:
----------------------------------
* SuRun uses Winlogons Desktop instead of creating an own one to avoid "Could 
  not create safe desktop" errors.
* SuRuns shows it's beta version number

SuRun 1.2.0.5 - 2008-09-16:
---------------------------
* A click on a Tray-Message-Window now closes it
* SuRun did not honor Windows' Object creator owner policy
* SuRuns blurred Background now shows transluent windows

SuRun 1.2.0.4 - 2008-09-14:
---------------------------
* YetAnotherStupidBug, InstallSuRun installed the 32 Bit SuRun on Windows x64.

SuRun 1.2.0.3 - 2008-09-11:
---------------------------
* FIX: Starting Explorer (Control Panel etc) as Administrator did only work, if 
  Folder Options->"Launch folder windows in a separate process" was activated.

SuRun 1.2.0.2 - 2008-09-10:
---------------------------
* SuRuns blurred screen background looks nicer
* SuRun also shows "Start as Administrator" on the recycle bin folder
* FIX: SuRun could not launch EFS encrypted applications "as Administrator"

SuRun 1.2.0.1 - 2008-08-27:
---------------------------
* InstallSuRun.exe passes command line to SuRun.exe, so "InstallSuRun /INSTALL" 
  will silently install SuRun on a system
* NEW command line switch /RESTORE <SuRunSettings>. 
  One needs to be a real Administrator to restore SuRun settings.
* Command line switch "/INSTALL" accepts <SuRunSettings> parameter.
  E.g. to silently deploy SuRun run "InstallSuRun /INSTALL MySuRunSetup.INI".
  One needs to be a real Administrator to deploy SuRun.
* "RunOnce" apps (that are executed by Explorer while the WinLogon Desktop 
  is still active) that seemed to require administrative privileges (e.g. 
  C:\Program files\Outlook Express\Setup50.exe) did block SuRuns Desktop.
* FIX: Clicking "Set recommended options for home users" with no users in the 
  SuRunners group enabled the check boxes of SuRun Settings Page 2. When then 
  clicking one of these boxes, SuRun Settings were terminated abnormally.
* FIX: InstallSuRun did not delete Temp files when it was started with limited 
  rights because MoveFileEx had no write access to HKLM.
* FIX: InstallSuRun sometimes did not work when run from the Desktop of an 
  limited user because access permissions denied access for Administrators.
* FIX: "Try to detect if unknown applications need to start with 
  elevated rights." could not be turned off.
* FIX: SuRun /RUNAS did not load the correct HKEY_CURRENT_USER
* Calls to LSA (lsass.exe) were extensively reduced.
* All User/Group functions now use impersonation. So they should not fail 
  anymore on domain computers.
* FIX: The Tray Icon caused ~400 context switches per second and thus ~2% CPU 
    Load on "slow" machines.

SuRun 1.2.0.0 - 2008-08-03:
---------------------------
* SuRun does not need nor store user passwords any more.
  SuRun does not need to put SuRunners into the Admin group anymore for 
  starting elevated Processes. SuRun does not need to use a helper process to 
  start the elevated process anymore.
  SuRun does not depend any more on the Secondary Logon Service.
  The new method of starting elevated processes also has one welcome side 
  effect. All Network drives of the logged on user remain connected.
* SuRun works in Windows Vista side by side with UAC
* SuRun can Backup and Restore SuRun settings
* SuRun can Export and Import a users program list
* SuRun uses tricks so that you can start Explorer after an elevated 
  Explorer runs. In Windows Vista SuRun uses Explorers command line switch

  "PlugPlay" service group, before the network is started.
* SuRun has a Blacklist for Programs not to hook

* SuRun does not try to start automagically elevated "AsInvoker" Apps
* "Restart as Admin" Processes are killed only AFTER the user chooses "OK"
* "Restart as Admin" Processes are killed the way TaskManager closes 
  Applications by sending WM_CLOSE to the top level widows of the process, 
  giving the process 5 seconds time to close and then terminating the process.

* FIX: SuRun created an endless loop of "SuRun /USERINST" processes when it 
  was run in the Ceedo sandbox.
* FIX: SuRuns System menu entries did not always show on the first click.

  the users desktop
* Safe Desktop is now created before the screenshot is made to save resources
* The WatchDog process now handles SwitchDesktop issues
* SuRun uses a separate thread to create and fade in the blurred screen
* FIX: When installing applications that require to reboot and to run a "Setup"
  on logon (XP SP3 is an example), SURUN asked to start that setup as Admin but

SuRun 1.1.0.6 - 2008-04-29:
----------------------------
* SuRun asks, if a user tries to restart the Windows Shell.
* Removed "Administrators see SuRun's Setup Dialog on their desktop" feature for
  two reasons: 
  1. The Settings dialog for normal users sometimes came up behind the blurred 
     background window. 
  2. The settings dialog was not closed when an Administrator did log off.
* IAT-Hook is again off by default because of incompatibilities with self 
  checking software. (E.G. Access 2003 and Outlook 2003)
* Removed Blurred Desktop flicker

SuRun 1.1.0.5 - 2008-04-23:
----------------------------
* Administrators see SuRun's Setup Dialog on their desktop

SuRun 1.1.0.4 - 2008-04-11:
----------------------------
* FIX: (!!!) The "[Meaning: Explorer My Computer\Control Panel]" display
       screwed up the command line causing SuRun to not work in many cases!

SuRun 1.1.0.3 - 2008-04-11:
----------------------------
* NEW: "SuRun's Settings" appears in the control panels category view in
       "Performance and Maintenance"
* NEW: SuRun displays "[Meaning: Explorer My Computer\Control Panel]" for shell 
       names like "Explorer ::{20D04FE0-3AEA-1069-A2D8-08002B30309D}\
       ::{21EC2020-3AEA-1069-A2DD-08002B30309D}"

       area when the current application does not run as the logged on user
* NEW: SuRun warns non restricted SuRunners and Administrators after login if 
       any Administrators have empty passwords
* NEW: Blurred background screen fades in and out
* NEW: User file list rules: "never start automatically"/"never start elevated"
* NEW: User file list "Add" and "Edit" shows the rule flags in a dialog
* NEW: Initialise desktop background before and close it after SwitchDesktop
* NEW: "Apply" Button in SuRun Settings
* CHG: SuRun's IAT-Hook is turned ON by default
* CHG: If Admin credentials are required, SuRun does not include Domain Admin 
       accounts in the drop down list
* CHG: Double click in user list does "Edit" the command line
* FIX: Scenario: Restircted SuRunner, changed password, SuRun asks to autorun 
       a predefined app with elevated rights, User presses 'Cancel'. Then the
       app was flagged "never start automagically".
* FIX: SuRun's "Run as..." and Administrator authentication respect the 
       "Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon 
       only" group policy.
* FIX: When using Sandboxie and the IAT-Hook, starting a sandboxed program 
       took about four minutes. SuRun now sees a blocked communication with 
       the server and exits immediately.
* FIX: "'Explorer here' as admin" did not open the folder, when it had spaces 
       in the name
* FIX: A user who was not allowed to change SuRun settings, could start the
       control panel as admin and then change SuRun's settings.

SuRun 1.1.0.2 - 2008-03-19:
----------------------------
* In a domain SuRun could not be used without being logged in to the domain. 

SuRun 1.1.0.1 - 2008-03-11:
----------------------------
* The IShellExecuteHook did not work properly because SuRun did not initialise 
  to zero the static variables it uses.

SuRun 1.1.0.0 - 2008-03-10: (changes to SuRun 1.0.2.9)
----------------------------
* SuRun's start menu entries were removed. 'SuRun Settings' and 'Uninstall 
  SuRun' can be done from the control panel.
* SuRun Installation can be done from "InstallSuRun.exe". InstallSuRun contains
  both, the 32Bit and 64Bit version and automatically installs the correct 
  version for your OS.
  Installation/Update is Dialog based with options:
    * "Do not change SuRun's file associations" on Update
    * Run Setup after Install on first Install
    * Show "Set 'Administrators' instead of 'Object creator' as default owner 
      for objects created by administrators." when this was not set before.
  Uninstallation is Dialog based with options
    * Keep all SuRun Settings
    * Delete "SuRunners"
    * Make SuRunners Admins
* SuRun runs in a domain. It enumerates domain accounts for administrative 
  authorization and uses the local group "SuRunners" for local authorization.
* SuRun can be restricted on a per User basis:
  - Users can be denied to use "SuRun setup".
  - Users can be restricted to specific applications that are allowed to run 
    with elevated rights
  This enables to use SuRun in Parent/Children scenarios or in Companies where 
  real Administrators want to work with lowered rights.
* SuRun can intercept the execution of processes by hooking the Import Address 
  Table of Modules (experimental) and by implementing the IShellExecuteHook
  Interface (recommended).
  Each SuRunner can specify a list of programs that will automagically started
  with elevated rights.
  Additionally SuRun parses processes for Vista Manifests and file names.
  -All files with extension msi and msc and all files with extension exe, cmd, 
   lnk, com, pif, bat and a file name that contains install, setup or update 
   are suspected that they must be run with elevated rights.
  -All files with a Vista RT_MANIFEST resource containing <*trustInfo>->
   <*security>-><*requestedPrivileges>-><*requestedExecutionLevel 
   level="requireAdministrator"> are suspected that they must be run with 
   elevated rights.
  The SuRunner can specify to start a program from the List with elevated 
  rights without being asked. If that happens, SuRun can show a Message window 
  on screen that a program was launched with elevated rights.
* FIX: SuRun could be hooked by IAT-Hookers. CreateProcessWithLogonW could 
  be intercepted by an IAT-Hooker and the Credentials could be used to run an 
  administrative process. Now a clean SuRun is started by the Service with 
  "AppInit_Dlls" disabled to do a clean CreateProcessWithLogonW.
* When User is in SuRunners and Explorer runs as Admin, SuRun urges the user 
  to logoff before SuRun can be used.
* Choosing "Don't ask this question again for this program" and pressing 
  cancel causes SuRun to auto-cancel all future requests to run this program
  with elevated rights.
* Non 'SuRunners' will not see any of SuRun's Execution Hooks, System menu 
  ((Re)Start as Administrator) or shell context menu (Control panel/cmd/
  Explorer as Administrator) entries.
* New self made Control Panel Icon
* SuRun tries to locate the Application to be started. So "surun cmd" will
  make ask SuRun whether "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" is allowed to run.
* SuRun's Shell integration can be customized.
* SuRun waits for max 3 minutes after the Windows start for the Service.
* New command line Option: /QUIET
* New Commands. If the User right-clicks on a folder background, two new Items,
  "'SuRun cmd' here" and "'SuRun Explorer' here" are shown.

* "SuRun *.reg" now starts "%Windir%\Regedit.exe *.reg" as Admin
* Added "Start as Admin" for *.reg files
* SuRun is now hidden from the frequently used program list of the Start menu

SuRun 1.0.2.110 - 2008-03-10: (Beta)
----------------------------
* InstallSuRun was not compatible with older SuRun (<=1.0.3.0) versions
* LogonCurrentUser/CurrUserAck did not display User Picture
* Hooks use >84k less stack space
* Safe Desktop uses less stack and seems to be YZshadow tolerant now
* FireFox Install/Update does work now
* Second try for empty passwords. Logon sometimes fails on first try.

SuRun 1.0.2.109 - 2008-03-02: (Beta)
----------------------------
* New self made Control Panel Icon
* The MIDL compiler sometimes did not work when SuRun's IAT-Hook was enabled.
  Now the Exec-Hooks do not allocate memory (calloc) anymore and MIDL works.
* Installation/Update is Dialog based with options:
  * "Do not change SuRun's file associations" on Update
  * Run Setup after Install on first Install
  * Show "Set 'Administrators' instead of 'Object creator' as default owner 
    for objects created by administrators." when this was not set before.
* Uninstallation is Dialog based with options
  * Keep all SuRun Settings
  * Delete "SuRunners"
  * Make SuRunners Admins

----------------------------
* SuRun optionally shows a tray window after elevated AutoRunning a process
* FIX: When uninstalling "Start as admin" for *.msc files was not removed
* Setup Dialog hides autorun icons if hooks are disabled
* Setup Dialog hides restriction icons if user is not restricted
* LoadLibrary("Shell32.dll") in WinMain() caused YZShadow to crash SuRun Setup
  When using YZShadow, you must manually add the following to YzShadow.ini:
    EXCLUSION_LIST_CLASSNAME=ScreenWndClass[TAB]#32770
    EXCLUSION_LIST_EXENAME=C:\WINDOWS\surun.exe[TAB]C:\WINDOWS\surun.exe
    ([TAB] means a TAB character (code 09))

SuRun 1.0.3.0 - 2008-02-15: BackPort Release (changes to SuRun 1.0.2.9)
---------------------------
Because of the vulnerability I ported some features of the current Beta back 
to the release version.
* FIX: SuRun could be hooked by IAT-Hookers. CreateProcessWithLogonW could 
  be intercepted by an IAT-Hooker and the Credentials could be used to run an 
  administrative process. Now a clean SuRun is started by the Service with 
  "AppInit_Dlls" disabled to do a clean CreateProcessWithLogonW.
* SuRun is now hidden from the frequently used program list of the Start menu
* SuRun tries to locate the Application to be started. So "surun cmd" will
  make ask SuRun whether "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" is allowed to run.
* "SuRun *.reg" now starts "%Windir%\Regedit.exe *.reg" as Admin
* Added "Start as Admin" for *.reg files
* Fixed "SuRun %SystemRoot%\System32\control.exe" and
  "SuRun %SystemRoot%\System32\ncpa.cpl"
* fixed command line processing for "SuRun *.msi"

SuRun 1.0.2.105 - 2008-02-15: (Beta)
----------------------------
*FIX: The IAT-Hook could cause circular calls that lead to Stack overflow

SuRun 1.0.2.104 - 2008-02-15: (Beta)
----------------------------
* FIX: Vista does not set a Threads Desktop until it creates a Window.
  This caused a Deadlock because the SuRun client did show a Message Box on 
  the secure Desktop that it does not have access to.
* ShellExecuteHook was replaced by Import Address Table (IAT) Hooking
  WARNING: This is pretty experimental:
  SuRunExt.dll get loaded into all Processes that have a Window or are linked 
  to user32.dll. SuRun intercepts all calls to LoadLibrary, CreateProcess 
  and GetProcAddress. This ables SuRun to run predefined apps with elevated 
  rights and to check for manifests/setup programs more efficiently than with 
  a IShellExecute hook.
* FIX: SuRun could be hooked by IAT-Hookers. CreateProcessWithLogonW could 
  be intercepted by an IAT-Hooker and the Credentials could be used to run an 
  administrative process. Now a clean SuRun is started by the Service with 
  "AppInit_Dlls" disabled to do a clean CreateProcessWithLogonW.
* ShellExtension will be installed/removed with Service Start/Stop

SuRun 1.0.2.103 - 2008-01-21: (Beta)
----------------------------
* ShellExecute Hook and Shell Context menu are now disabled for non "SuRunners"
* The Acronis TrueImage (SwitchDesktop) fix was disabled in SuRun 1.0.2.102

SuRun 1.0.2.102 - 2008-01-20: (Beta)
----------------------------
* ShellExecute Hook and Shell Context menu are now disabled for Administrators
* SuRun now runs in Windows Vista :)) with UAC disabled
* SuRun now Enables/Disables IShellExecHook in Windows Vista
* "SuRun *.reg" now starts "%Windir%\Regedit.exe *.reg" as Admin
* Added "Start as Admin" for *.reg files

SuRun 1.0.2.101 - 2008-01-07: (Beta)
----------------------------
* Fixed "AutoRun" ShellExecuteHook. In an AutoRun.inf in K:\ win an [AutoRun] 
  entry of 'open=setup.exe /autorun' caused the wrong command line 
  'SuRun.exe "setup.exe /autorun" /K:\'
* The english String for <IDS_DELUSER> was missing.

SuRun 1.0.2.100 - 2008-01-07: (Beta)
----------------------------
* Fixed "SuRun %SystemRoot%\System32\control.exe" and
  "SuRun %SystemRoot%\System32\ncpa.cpl"
* Added ShellExecuteHook support for verbs "AutoRun" and "cplopen".
  So SuRun can now automatically start "*.cpl" files and AutoRun.INF entries 
  on removable media with elevated rights
* Choosing "Don't ask this question again for this program" and pressing 
  cancel causes SuRun to auto-cancel all future requests to run this program
  with elevated rights.

SuRun 1.0.2.99 - 2008-01-06: (Beta)
---------------------------
* Removed parsing for Vista Manifests with <*requestedExecutionLevel 
   level="highestAvailable">.

SuRun 1.0.2.98 - 2008-01-05: (Beta)
---------------------------
* SuRun is now hidden from the frequently used program list of the Start menu
* SuRun's file name pattern matching for files with SPACEs did not work.

SuRun 1.0.2.97 - 2008-01-04: (Beta)
---------------------------
* fixed command line processing for "SuRun *.msi"
* changed "'cmd <folder>' as administrator" and "'Explorer <folder>' as 
  administrator" to "'SuRun cmd' here" and "'SuRun Explorer' here"
* Administrators will not see any of SuRun's System menu or shell menu entries
* Added parsing for Vista Manifests and Executable file name pattern matching.
  -All files with extension msi and msc and all files with extension exe, cmd, 
   lnk, com, pif, bat and a file name that contains install, setup or update 
   are suspected that they must be run with elevated rights.
  -All files with a Vista RT_MANIFEST resource containing <*trustInfo>->
   <*security>-><*requestedPrivileges>-><*requestedExecutionLevel 
   level="requireAdministrator|highestAvailable"> are suspected that they must 
   be run with elevated rights.

SuRun 1.0.2.96 - 2007-12-23: (Beta)
---------------------------
* Setup User Interface improvements
* Speedups for Domain computers
* Simplification in the group membership check for SuRunners
* The "Is Client an Admin?" check is now done with the user token of the client 
  process and not with the group membership of the client user name
***Hopefully all speedups and simplifications did not cause security wholes***

SuRun 1.0.2.95 - 2007-12-09: (Beta)
---------------------------
* Acronis TrueImage (SwitchDesktop) caused the users files list control not to 
  be drawn.

SuRun 1.0.2.94 - 2007-12-09: (Beta)
---------------------------
* Context menu for Folders in Explorer (cmd/Explorer <here> as admin)
* When clicking the "Add..." user program button, *.lnk files are resolved to 
  their targets
* File Open/Save Dialogs now show all extensions in SuRun Setup.


SuRun 1.0.2.93 - 2007-12-07: (Beta)
---------------------------
* New Commands. If the User right-clicks on a folder background, two new Items,
  "'cmd <folder>' as administrator" and "'Explorer <folder>' as administrator"
  are shown.
* New command line Option: /QUIET
* New: SuRun runs in a domain. It enumerates domain accounts for administrative 
  authorization and uses the local group "SuRunners" for local authorization.
* SuRun waits for max 3 minutes after the Windows start for the Service.
* SuRun tries to locate the Application to be started. So "surun cmd" will
  make ask SuRun whether "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" is allowed to run.
* Users can make Windows Explorer run specific Applications always with 
  elevated rights. (No "SuRun" command required.)
* SuRun can be restricted on a per User basis:
  - Users can be denied to use "SuRun setup".
  - Users can be restricted to specific applications that are allowed to run 
    with elevated rights
  This enables to use SuRun in Parent/Children scenarios or in Companies where 
  real Administrators want to work with lowered rights.
* SuRun's Shell integration can be customized.

SuRun 1.0.2.9 - 2007-11-17:
---------------------------
* SuRun now sets an ExitCode
* FIX: In Windows XP a domain name can have more than DNLEN(=15) characters.
    This caused GetProcessUsername() to fail and NetLocalGroupAddMembers() 
    to return "1: Invalid Function".
* Fixed a Bug in the LogonDialog that could cause an exception.

SuRun 1.0.2.8 - 2007-10-11:
---------------------------
* Added code to avoid Deadlock with AntiVir's RootKit detector "avipbb.sys" 
  that breaks OpenProcess()
* Added code to recover SuRun's Desktop when user processes call SwitchDesktop
  "shedhlp.exe", part of Acronis True Image Home 11 calls SwitchDesktop() 
  periodically and so switches from SuRun's Desktop back to the users Desktop.

SuRun 1.0.2.7 - 2007-09-21:
---------------------------
* Fixed a Bug in the Sysmenuhook that caused "start as administrator" to
  fire multiple times.

SuRun 1.0.2.6 - 2007-09-20:
---------------------------
* SuRun - x64 Version added, the version number is the same because SuRun 
  has no new functions or bugfixes

SuRun 1.0.2.6 - 2007-09-14:
---------------------------
* With the Option "Store &Passwords (protected, encrypted)" disabled SuRun 
  did not start any Process...Thanks to A.H.Klein for reporting.

SuRun 1.0.2.5 - 2007-09-05:
---------------------------
* Empty user passwords did not work in an out of the box Windows. Users 
  were forced to use the policy editor to set "Accounts: Limit local 
  account use of blank passwords to console logon only" to "Disabled".
  Now SuRun temporarily sets this policy automatically to "Disabled" and 
  after starting the administrative process SuRun restores the policy.

SuRun 1.0.2.4 - 2007-08-31:
---------------------------
* SuRun has been translated to polish by sarmat, Thanks! :-)
* Microsoft Installer Patch Files (*.msp) can be started with elevated rights

SuRun 1.0.2.3 - 2007-08-18:
---------------------------
* SuRun now works with users that have an empty password

SuRun 1.0.2.2 - 2007-07-30:
---------------------------
* Added SuRun Version display to setup dialog caption

SuRun 1.0.2.1 - 2007-07-24:
---------------------------
* The way that SuRun checks a users group membership was changed
* "surun ncpa.cpl" did not work
* SuRun now reports detailed, why a user could not be added or removed to/from 
  a user group
* SuRun now assures that a "SuRunner" is NOT member of "Administrators"
* SuRun now checks that a user is member of "Administrators" or "SuRunners" 
  before launching setup
* SuRun now starts/resumes the "Secondary Logon" service automatically
* SuRun now complains if the windows shell is running as Administrator

SuRun 1.0.2.0 - 2007-05-29:
---------------------------
* SuRun Setup now contains new options:
   -Allow 'SuRunners' to set (and show) the system time
   -Allow 'SuRunners' to change 'Power Options' and select power schemes
   -Show Windows update notifications to all users
   -No auto-restart for scheduled Automatic Windows Update installations
   -Set 'Administrators' instead of 'Object creator' as default owner for 
    objects created by administrators
  The last option is pretty important!

SuRun 1.0.1.2 - 2007-05-16:
---------------------------
* Sven (http://speedproject.de) found a bug in the context menu extension for 
  the Desktop. The Entries for the sub menu "new" were not displayed when 
  SuRun was active.
* All calls GetWindowsDirectory were replaced with GetSystemWindowsDirectory 
  to make SuRun work with Windows 2003 Terminal Server Edition
* Control Panel and Control Panel Applets were not shown in Win2k, Win2k3.
  SuRun now sets the DWORD value "SeparateProcess" in the registry path
  "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced" to 1 to
  let Explorer start a separate Process for the control panel. The main control 
  panel is now started with Explorer using the "Workspace\Control Panel" GUIDs.
  Control Panel Applets are now started with RunDLL32 instead of control.exe.

SuRun 1.0.1.1 - 2007-05-13:
---------------------------
* Sven (http://speedproject.de) fixed some typos and beautified the logon 
  dialogs, Thanks!

SuRun 1.0.1.0 - 2007-05-11:
---------------------------
* Added Whitelist for programs that are always run without asking
* When finally uninstalling SuRun the registry is cleaned
* Logon dialogs are resized only if the command line is too long
* Dialogs have a 40s Timeout to automatic "cancel"
* SuRun retries to open the service pipe for 3 minutes. This is useful, when a 
  user starts multiple apps in short intervals. (e.g. from the StartUp menu)

SuRun 1.0.0.1 - 2007-05-09:
---------------------------
* Fixed possible CreateRemoteThread() attack. Access for current user to 
  processes started by SuRun is now denied.

SuRun 1.0.0.0 - 2007-05-08:
---------------------------
* first public release
